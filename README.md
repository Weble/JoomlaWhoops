# Joomla Whoops! - Better Error Page Handler for Joomla!

Joomla plugin to transform the default joomla error page into something more usable for debugging errors.
It implements the [whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) php library to show a readable stack backtrace when 
error occurs.

## Installation

Download the package from the [releases section](https://github.com/Weble/JoomlaWhoops/releases) here on github and install it through the joomla installer.

## Configuration

Enable the plugin, and choose when the error page will be displayed.

By default, it works only with Joomla's Debug mode set to on, but you can also choose to show it to specific user groups, 
when a specific key is present in the url, or always.
